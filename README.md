# Paper_Fusion_Voting_NY
Code and Data for the working paper "FUSION VOTING AND POLARIZATION IN NEW YORK."
A working draft of the paper can be found at my website: https://mawalz05.wixsite.com/website. 

In order to create the tables and figures in the draft, you need both Stata and R. 

The NYvsNE_D&D_Plots.do file is the Stata Do-File that contains the code to recreate the difference-in-differences estimates as well as the Polarization plots.

The Fusion_2.R file contains the R code to recreate the regression analysis for the Figures and Tables in the Results section of the paper.
